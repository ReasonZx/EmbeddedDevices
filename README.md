# EmbeddedDevices


Framework? VS Code or vi for actual code. PlatformI/O for MCUs, C/C++ for server code, Qt5 for the beautiful UIs that make noobs feel tec-ompetent, Android Studio for mobile apps, XCode & vi / cmake for MacOS, middle finger to IOS, JB Weld for wood/glass/plastics, Lincoln Electric for steel or aluminum, Kubota, rebar & portland cement for rock or mud.

You can't spell evil without vi, and the goal is to hack ALL the things.
